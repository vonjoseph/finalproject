				<p>Broadway is a billion-dollar juggernaut. The 2015-16 season saw 13.32 million tickets sold, 220,000 more than the year before. In the last five years, shows grossed more than $6 billion. It’s not surprising that the industry’s national trade organization, 
				The Broadway League, keeps a meticulous accounting of seats, ticket sales and cast lists, all of which are updated weekly
				If you split Broadway genres into plays and musicals, white actors dominate both. Plays, which are generally regarded as riskier endeavors for producers, make less money than musicals ($181 million versus $1.17 billion in the 2014-15 season).
				Musicals draw more tourists as well as reliably contain more roles for people of color.
				</p> <br>
				<p>
				This might be the most frustrating thing of all for minority performers. It points to the crucial ways in which the theater world remains segregated. And while actors of color are seeing what Bandhu calls a “renaissance” in terms of interesting new work being written for them (Vietgone,
				Here Lies Love), there’s an invisible fence that keeps them from stepping out of the narrowly defined roles that are allotted to them.
				Though issues such as civil rights receive far greater attention than cultural diversity within artistic institutions and fields, each of the producers interviewed made a compelling case that diversity behind the scenes in the arts has far-reaching implications for the business world and society at large. Their personal journeys and challenges are a stark reminder that even in the age of the first black president, there remain American professions in which black Americans are virtually nonexistent. Furthermore, 
				there are power structures in place that ensure that certain professions will remain that way unless a conscious choice is made to change things.
