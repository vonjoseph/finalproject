					<h2>Eclipsed, Starring Lupita Nyong'o</h2>
					<br>
				</hgroup>
				<p> In Response to the lack of Black Actors and Actresses on Broadway, Danai Gurira's developed Eclipsed with a limited Broadway at the Golden Theatre.
                  Eclipsed is a play, about a group of women being held captive in the African nation of Liberia, stars Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o and which officially opened in March, following previews that began February, with great reviews. Upon closing, the critically acclaimed drama will have played 14 previews and 121 regular performances.
                  The Off-Broadway production at the Public Theater was extended twice and closed November 29, 2015. The complete cast from the original run joined the 12 Years a Slave actress on the Broadway stage: Pascale Armand, Akosua Busia, Zainab Jah and Saycon Sengbloh. The production was helmed by Liesl Tommy.
                  This African American production was nominated for six Tony Awards, winning Best Costume Design of a Play for Clint Ramos.

				<p>The “vitally important” play is a story of survival and resilience set in post-colonial Africa. Here's how the show is billed: 
				“Amid the chaos of the Liberian Civil War, the captive wives of a rebel officer band together to form a fragile community – until the balance of their lives is upset by the arrival of a new girl. 
				Drawing on reserves of wit and compassion, Eclipsed reveals distinct women who must discover their own means of survival in this deeply felt portrait of women finding and testing their own strength in a hostile world of horrors not of their own making.”
                Producers also previously noted that Eclipsed marked a historic moment on Broadway: “the first time the cast, director, and playwright are composed entirely of female artists, fitting for a production that so stunningly chronicles the experiences of a group of very resilient women.”
				The variability and lack of steady increase on the numbers suggest that while in recent seasons there might be more roles being written for and shows being produced that feature people of color, 
				there’s no evidence of people of color being asked to audition more for the current crop of existing roles. This might be the frustrating thing of all for minority performers. 
				It points to the crucial ways in which the theater world remains segregated. And while actors of color are seeing what Bandhu calls a “renaissance” in terms of interesting new work being written for them (Vietgone, Here Lies Love), there’s an invisible fence that keeps them from stepping out of the narrowly defined roles that are allotted to them.
