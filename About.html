				African American Theatre is a vibrant and unique entity enriched by ancient Egyptian rituals, West African folklore, and European theatrical practices. A continuum of African folk traditions, this theatre combines storytelling, mythology, rituals, music, song, and dance with ancestor worship from ancient times to the present. It has afforded black artists a cultural gold mine to celebrate what it has been like to be an African American in The New World. 
                Black theatre boasts award-winning playwrights, actors, directors, choreographers, designers, and theatre companies. 
                It refined and redefined the popular minstrel tradition-America's first pure form of entertainment. 
                It helped to originate and shape America's musical comedy format. It brought to the American stage a rich theatrical history and cultural practice, and captivated American as well as European audiences with its Charleston dance craze and rhythms. Due to social restrictions that created major barriers to its development, it took the fledgling African American theatre a few centuries longer to find its place within American theatre and popular entertainment.

                 Black theatre, in the United States, dramatic movement encompassing plays written by, for, and about African Americans.
                 The minstrel shows of the early 19th century are believed by some to be the roots of black theatre, but they initially were written by whites, 
                 acted by whites in blackface, and performed for white audiences. 
                 After the American Civil War, blacks began to perform in minstrel shows (then called “Ethiopian minstrelsy”), and by the turn of the 20th century 
                 they were producing black musicals, many of which were written, 
                 produced, and acted entirely by blacks. The first known play by an American black was James Brown’s King Shotaway (1823). William Wells Brown’s The Escape; 
                 or, A Leap for Freedom (1858), was the first black play published, but the first real success of a black dramatist was Angelina W. Grimké’s Rachel (1916).
                 Black theatre flourished during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s. Experimental groups and black theatre companies emerged in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Among these was the Ethiopian Art Theatre, which established Paul Robeson as America’s foremost black actor. Garland Anderson’s play Appearances (1925) 
                 was the first play of black authorship to be produced on Broadway, but black theatre did not create a Broadway hit until Langston Hughes’s Mulatto (1935) won wide acclaim. In that same year the Federal Theatre Project was founded, providing a training ground for blacks. In the late 1930s, black community theatres began to appear, revealing talents such as those of Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. By 1940 black theatre was firmly grounded in the American Negro Theater and the Negro Playwrights’ Company.
